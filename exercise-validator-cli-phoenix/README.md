## üìö Available commands

| Command                   | Description                                  |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `gf -h` or `gf --help`    | List the available commands and their usage. |
| `gf config`               | Configure the application.                   |
| `gf start <markdown url>` | Start a daily workshop.                      |
| `gf verify <filename>`    | Verify the selected exercise.                |
| `gf rate <filename>`      | Rate the selected exercise.                  |

## üìÑ Usage

After the installation you have to execute `gf config` and provide your GitHub
credentials.** It will create a GitHub token and store it under `.gf/` folder in
your home directory.  
Then you will have to initialize the day by executing
`gf start <markdown url>`. It will download the exercises for that day into the
current directory. One folder represents one day so you can only use this
command once in a folder. A *markdown url* is an url to the current workshop's
language specified markdown file.  
When you have the solution for an exercise you can verify it by the `gf verify
<filename>` command.
You can rate an exercise between 1 to 5 by the `gf rate <filename>` command.

** Windows users should execute `gf config` either in windows CMD **OR** should execute `winpty gf config`
